FUTURE_PE_01 – AI Website Copy Generator for Local Businesses
Task Description

This project was created as part of the Future Interns Prompt Engineering Internship – Task 1.

The objective of Task 1 was to design a structured prompt system that generates high-conversion website copy for local businesses.

The system focuses on:

Homepage copy with strong value proposition

Service section descriptions

Persuasive call-to-action (CTA) sections

Tone adaptation for different business types

Website-ready, human-sounding content

AI Tools Used

Lovable AI – UI-based copy generation

Large Language Model (LLM) – Content generation

GitHub – Documentation and version control

How AI Was Used
1. Structured Prompt Architecture

A master prompt was designed with the following layers:

Role Definition (Conversion Copywriter + UX Strategist)

Input Variables (Business Name, Industry, Location, Audience, Differentiator, Tone)

Defined Output Sections

Constraint-Based Writing Rules

Anti-Cliché Filtering

Local Relevance Integration

The prompt ensures consistent structure and adaptable tone for different local businesses.

2. Prompt Testing
   
The generator was tested using a real local gym business to evaluate:

Clarity of value proposition

Tone alignment (Bold / Motivational)

Strength of CTA variations

Natural, non-corporate language

Local relevance integration

The test produced:

3. Hero headline variations

Value-focused subheadline

CTA variations

Service descriptions

FAQ section

Closing CTA
